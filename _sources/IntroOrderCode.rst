Introduction to Order Code Problems (Mixed Up Code)
-----------------------------------------------------

In order code problems the correct code is given, but it is broken into code blocks and is mixed up shown in Figure 1.

You will drag the needed code blocks from left to right to create a correct solution on the right side.  There may be additional code blocks that you don't need in the correct solution as shown in Figure 2.  You will click the |checkme| button to check your solution. 

.. note::

   You will also have to indent the code blocks correctly, which you can do by dragging the blocks right to indent or left to reduce the indention.
