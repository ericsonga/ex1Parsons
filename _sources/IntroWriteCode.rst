Introduction to Write Code Problems
------------------------------------

In write code problems you will be given the start of a function followed by code to test the function and will be asked to finish writing the function as shown in Figure 1 below.

The tests that are after the function will check that the function returns the correct values after you click the |runbutton| button.  Each test will print |pass| if the test was successful as shown in Figure 2 or |fail| if it was not.
