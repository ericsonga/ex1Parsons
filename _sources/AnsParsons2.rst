Answer 2: Find the Minimum Value
---------------------------------

To find the minimum value, create a variable to keep track of the minimum value found so far and set it to the first item in the list to start.  Then loop through all the values in the list and each time test if the current value is less than the saved minimum value.  If it is, then set the minimum value to the current value.  Return the minimum value.
