Start the Exam
==================

Click the |start| button to start the exam and show the problem.
    
Failing Tests
================

The hidden tests that are after the function will check that the function returns the correct values after you click the |runbutton| button.  Each test will print |pass| if the test was successful or |fail| if it was not as shown in the figure below.  If a test fails fix the code and run it again to test it again.
