Order Code Practice Problem
----------------------------

Construct a function ``getSum(numList)`` that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the values in the list. To calculate the sum initialize the sum to zero and then loop through all values in the list and add each one to the sum. Return the sum.

Examples
=========

The call ``getSum([0, 1])`` should return 1 since ``0 + 1 = 1``.  The call ``getSum([1, 2, 3])`` should return 6 since ``1 + 2 + 3 = 6``.

.. note::

    Since this is just practice I will help you solve this problem.  After you click on the |start| button below you can use the code below to help you figure out the correct order of the code blocks and the correct indentation.  The code blocks below include two extra *distractor* blocks, ``for num in numList`` and ``return Sum``, that are not needed in the correct solution. 

.. code-block:: python

   def getSum(numList):
       sum = 0
       for num in numList:
           sum = sum + num
       return sum

      The code below is mixed up and contains extra blocks that are not needed that are shown paired with the correct code.  Drag the needed code from the left to the right and put them in order with the correct indentation so that the code would work correctly.  To indent just drag the block further to the right. Click the "Check Me" button to see if your solution is correct.
