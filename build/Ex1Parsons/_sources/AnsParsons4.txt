Answer 4: Get Sum In Range
-----------------------------------------------------------

To get the sum of a list of numbers between a given start and end index (inclusive) create a variable to keep track of the sum and initialize it to 0.  Then loop from the start index to the end index (inclusive).  Get the value at the current index and add it to the sum.  Return the sum.
