Introduction to Order Code Problems (Mixed Up Code)
-----------------------------------------------------

In order code problems the correct code is given, but it is broken into code blocks and is mixed up as shown in the figure below. The code can also contain
extra blocks called *distractors* that are not part of a correct solution.  Notice that the distractors are shown paired with the correct code with purple highlights on the right and left edges of the paired blocks.

Start the Exam
==================

Click the |start| button to start the exam and show the problem.
    
Drag Blocks From Left To Right and Indent Them
================================================
    
You will drag the needed code blocks from left to right to create a correct solution on the right side.  There will be additional *distractor* code blocks that you don't need in the correct solution and can leave on the left side as shown in the figure below.  You will click the |checkme| button to check your solution. 

.. note::

   You will also have to indent the code blocks correctly, which you can do by dragging the blocks right to indent or left to reduce the indentation.
   
The figure below shows a correct solution with the extra code blocks on the left that were not needed in the solution.  If you solve the problem (it prints "Perfect!" after the problem) then click the |finish| button.  You can also click the |finish| button if you want to move on, even if you haven't solved the problem yet.

Incorrect Indentation Error
==============================
    
You will be told if a block is not correctly indented as shown in the figure below.  The arrows indicate the direction to move the highlighted block.

Incorrect Order or Replace Block Error
=======================================

You will be told if a block is in the wrong place or needs to be replaced (if it is a distractor block) as shown in the figure below.
